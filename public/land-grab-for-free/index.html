      i. last sleepover, kin
      we held each other closer\n
      her father + our grandfather passed away\nhere, in\nthis very building\n
      a hyper realistic photo of the passion of Christ\nbeside us, in its (bloody) (violent(/ce)/ glory)\n
      the statue with the pools of blood we had taken out of the room,
       \n
      instinct told us our ancestors are watching,
