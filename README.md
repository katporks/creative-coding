# creative-coding
I attended a Coding for Artists workshop from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) led by Qianqian Ye which inspired me through works of other queer/poc artists using the library p5.js. The following works began as prototypes on the p5.js sandbox. 

For device responsiveness, I added `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` within the html head tags and the following for css:
```
html, body {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

canvas {
  display: block;
  height: 100%;
}
```


## santan-chain 
"santan-chain" is an interactive sandbox loosely based on one of the first creative coding examples by Qianqian. I added a randomized the range of colors to reflect that of the "santan" flowers in my childhood back yard. I added an `isTouching` state to have the petals be created when the touch event starts until it is let go. The leaves or stems within the randomized shades of green that I remember is created while there are no touch events adding nodes of leaves in moments of pause.

The following are works sent to me by family and friends in the Philippines and in Vancouver.
